# Fraud_Detection_In_Financial_Transactions
Internship Project at Codec Technologies Detecting Frauds in Financial Transactions

## Project Overview
This project aims to **identify suspicious or fraudulent financial transactions** using machine learning. The solution uses both **supervised and unsupervised techniques** to detect anomalies in credit card transactions.  

The project leverages the following:

- **Supervised Models:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost  
- **Unsupervised Models for Anomaly Detection:** Isolation Forest, AutoEncoder  
- **Class Imbalance Techniques:** SMOTE, Random Undersampling, Class Weights  
- **Data Visualization & EDA:** Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- **Deployment:** Streamlit app for interactive testing

## Dataset
The dataset used is the **Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset** from Kaggle:

[Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)  

> **Note:** For privacy reasons, the dataset is not uploaded to this repository. Please download it from Kaggle and process it as required before retraining models.
